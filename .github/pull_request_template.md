Important! Please follow the guidelines for naming Pull Requests: 
<https://docs.dasch.swiss/latest/developers/contribution/#pull-request-guidelines>

**Note:** 
When squash-merging a PR into the main branch, 
the PR title will be taken as squash-merge commit message that appears in the commit history of the main branch. 
But this automatism only works for PRs that consist of more than one commit. 
If a PR consists of a single commit, 
GitHub will take the name of this single commit as squash-merge-commit message. 
In this case, you have to manually ensure that the squash-merge commit message is identical to the PR title.
