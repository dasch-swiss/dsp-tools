Important! Please follow the guidelines for naming Pull Requests: 
https://docs.dasch.swiss/latest/developers/dsp/contribution/#pull-request-guidelines

**Note:** When squash-merging a PR into the main branch, the PR title will be taken as squash-merge commit message that 
appears in the main branch. But this automatism only works for PRs that consist of more than one commit. If a PR consists 
of *only one* commit, GitHub will take the name of the commit as squash-merge-commit message. In this case, you have to
manually ensure that the squash-merge commit message is identical to the PR title.
