# Excel files for data modelling and data import
dsp-tools is able to process Excel files and output the appropriate JSON or XML file. The JSON/XML file can then
be used to create the ontology on the DSP server or import data to the DSP repository. dsp-tools can also be used to
create a list from an Excel file.

## Create flat or hierarchical lists from an Excel file
Lists or controlled vocabularies are sets of fixed terms that are used to characterize objects. Hierarchical lists
correspond to classifications or taxonomies. With dsp-tools a list can be created from an Excel file. The expected
format of the Excel file is described [here](./dsp-tools-create.md#lists-from-excel).
