# DSP tools to use Excel-files for data modelling and data import
Dsp-tools is able to directly read and process excel files and output the appropriate JSON and/or XML-files for
importing data to the dsp-repository.

## Flat and hierarchical lists
Lists or "controlled vocabularies" are sets of fixed terms that are used to characterize something. Hierarchical lists
correspond to classifications or taxonomies.

The format of the excel is described  [here](./dsp-tools-create.md#lists-from-excel).
