[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/knora.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/knora)

# Knora XML-file format for importing data
The import file is a standard XML file as decribed below.

## Preamble
The import file must start with the standard XML header:
```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
```

## &lt;knora&gt;
The `<knora>`-element describes a set of resources that are to be imported. It is the
container for an arbitrary number of `resource` elements and may only
contain resource tags.
The `<knora>`-eelement defines has the following options:

- _xmlns:xsi_: `"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"` [required]
- _xsi:schemaLocation_: Path to knora XML schema file for validation [optional]
- _shortcode_: Knora project shortcode, e.g. "0801" [required]
- _ontology_: Name of the ontology [required]

Thus, the `<knora>`-eelment may b used as follows:
```xml
<knora
 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
 xsi:schemaLocation="../knora-data-schema.xsd"
 shortcode="0806"
 ontology="webern">
…
</knora>
```
The `<knora>`-element can only contain
- `<permissions>`-elements
- `<resource>`-elements

The permissions are implemented for importing data using permission sets. A permission set is
a named element that contains the permissions for selected resources or values.
In order to give a resource a value the permission, the named permission set is referenced.

### &lt;permissions&gt;
The DSP-server provides for each resource and each field of a resource access control. For a more thorough discussion
of the permission and access system of the DSP platform, see
[DSP platform permissions](https://docs.knora.org/02-knora-ontologies/knora-base/#permissions)
The following access rights are defined by the DSP platform which apply to either the resource or field:

- `RV`: _Restricted View permission_: The user sees a somehow restricted view of the element. E.g. in case of a still image
  resource, the image is displeyed at reduced resolution or with a watermark overlay.
- `V`: _View permission_: The user has read access to the element
- `M`: _Modifiy permission_: The user may alter/modify the element, but may not delete it
- `D`: _Delete permission_: The user is allowed to delete the element
- `CR`: _Change Right permission_: The user may change the permission of the element

The user does not hold directly the permissions, but may belong to an arbitrary number of groups which hold the
permissions. By default, the following groups always exist, and each user belongs to at least one of them

- `UnkownUser`: The user is not known to the DSP platform (no login)
- `KnownUser`: The user is known (performed login), but is not member of the project the element belongs to
- `ProjectMember`: The user belongs to the same project as the data element retrieved
- `ProjectAdmin`: The user is project administrator in the project the data element belongs to
- `Creator`: The user is the "owner" of the element, that is the one that created the element
- `SystemAdmin`: System administrator

In addition, more groups with arbitrary names can be created by the project admins. For referencing such a group,
the projectname has to be prepended before the group name separated by a colon, e.g. `knora-py-test:MlsEditors`.

A `<permissions>`-element contains the permissions given to the selected groups and is called a _permission set_. It
contains a mandatory option `id` and must contain at least one `<allow>`-element per user group indicating the group's 
permission. It has the form:
```xml
     <permissions id="res-default">
        <allow group="UnknownUser">RV</allow>
        <allow group="KnownUser">V</allow>
        <allow group="Creator">CR</allow>
        <allow group="ProjectAdmin">CR</allow>
        <allow group="knora-py-test:MlsEditors">D</allow>
    </permissions>
```

_Options_:
- _id_: Unique id (an xs:ID) for the permission set. It is used to reference a permission set.

_Subelements allowed_:
- `<allow>`: defines the permission for one group

#### &lt;allow&gt;
The `<allow>`-element is used to defined the permission for one group. It has the form:
```xml
    <allow group="ProjectAdmin">CR</allow>>
```
The allowed values are
(see [Knora-documentation](https://docs.knora.org/paradox/02-knora-ontologies/knora-base.html#permissions)
for a more detailed description of the Knora permission system):

- _"RV"_: Restricted view: Th associated media is shown in reduced quality.
- _"V"_: View: The user is able to view the data readonly
- _"M"_: Modifiy: The user may modify of a value. The original value will be preserved using the history mchanism.
- _"D"_: Delete: The user is able to mark a resource of a value as deleted.
- _"CR"_: The user is able to change the right of a resource or value

The `group` option is mandatory.

_Options_:

- _group_: Defines the group for the permission. The knora systemgroups as well as project speccific groups are supported.
           A project specific group name has the form `project-shortname:groupnam`. The system groups are:
    - "UnknownUser"
    - "KnownUser"
    - "ProjectMember"
    - "Creator"
    - "ProjectAdmin"
    - "SystemAdmin"
    
_Subelements allowed_: None
 
### `<resource>`
A `resource`-element contains all necessary information to create a resource. It
has the following options:

_Options_:

- _label_: The label, a human readable, semantical meaningfull short name of the resource [required]
- _restype_: The resource type as defined within the ontology [required]
- _id_: A unique, arbitrary string giving a unique ID to the resource. This ID is only used during the
  import process for referencing this resource from other resources. During the import process, it will be replaced by
  the IRI used internally by Knora. [required]
- _permissions_: a reference to a permission set. These permissions will be applied to the newly created resoource.
  [optional]

````
<resource label="EURUS015a"
          restype="Postcard"
          unique_id="238807"
          permissions="res-def-perm">
…
</resource>
````

The `<resource>`-element contains for each property class a `property`-element which itself
contains one or several `value`-elements. It _must_ also contain an `<image>`-element if the
resource is a StillImage. The `property`-element must have the option `name` present which
indicates the property class from the project specific ontology where the values belong to.

_name_-option:

- _"name"_: Name of the property as given in the ontology

Example:
```xml
<text-prop name="hasTranslation">
```
 
The `<resource>`-element may contain the following tags describing properties (data fields):

- _`<image>`_: In case of the StillImageResource contains the path to the image file.
- _`<text-prop>`_: Contains text values
- _`<color-prop>`_: Contains color values
- _`<date-prop>`_: Contains date values
- _`<decimal-prop>`_: Contains decimal values
- _`<geometry-prop>`_: Contains a JSON geometry definition for a region
- _`<geoname-prop>`_: Contains a geoname.org location code
- _`<list-prop>`_: Contains list elements labels
- _`<iconclass-prop>`_: Contains iconclass.org codes
- _`<integer-prop>`_: Contains integer values
- _`<interval-prop>`_: Contains interval values
- _`<period-prop>`_: Contains time period values
- _`<resptr-prop>`_: Contains links othr resources
- _`<time-prop>`_: Contains time values
- _`<uri-prop>`_: Contains URI values
- _`<boolean-prop>`_: Contains boolean values

#### `<image>`-element
The `<image>`-element contains the path to an image file. It must only be used if the
resource is a `StillImageResource`!

_Options_:
- none

_Note_: There is only _one_ `<image>`-element allowed per StillImageResource!

Example:
```xml
<image>postcards.dir/images/EURUS015a.jpg</image>
```


#### `<text-prop>`-element
The text property element is used to list text values.

The `<text-prop>`-element must contain at least one `<text>`-element. There are several variants of text tags:

_Options_:
- _"name"_: Name of the property as given in the ontology  (required)

##### `<text>`-element
The `<text>`-element has the following options:
- _encoding_: either "utf8" or "hex64" [required]
  - _utf8_: The element describes a simple text without markup. The text is a simple utf-8 string
  - _hex64_: The elemen describes a complex text containing markup. It must be a hex64 encoded string in the
  XML-format as defined by Knora.
- _resrefs_: A list of resource ID's that are referenced in the markup, separated by the "|"-character such as `"2569981|6618"` [optional]
- _permissions_: ID or a permission set. Optional, but if omitted very restricted default permissions apply!
- _comment_: A comment to this specific value.

Knora-xml-import assumes that for markup-text (standoff-markup) standard mapping for Knora is being used (Custom mapping to
customized standoff tags is not yet implemented!)

E.g. a text containing a link to another resource must have the following form before being
encoded as hex64-string:
```xml
'<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>Brief: <a class="salsah-link" href="IRI:6618:IRI"><p>Webern an Willheim, 10.10.1928</p></a>'
```
Please note that the href-option withiin the anchor tag points to an internal resource of knora
and this has to have the special format "`IRI:`res-id`:IRI`" where res-id is the resource
id defined within the XML import file. A resource already existing in knora can be referenced by
indicating its IRI directly has _href_-option.

In case the string references one or more internal resources, the option `resrefs`_must_ be using to
indicate there ID's! The ID's are separated by a "|"-character

A complete example for a simple text:
```xml
<text-prop name="hasComment">
   <text encoding="utf8">Probe bei "Wimberger". Lokal in Wien?</text>
</text-prop>
```
A complete example of a complex text which encodes the text `<a class="salsah-link" href="IRI:6618:IRI"><p>Webern an Willheim, 10.10.1928</p></a><p></p>` containing
a link to the internal resource with the ID="6618":
```xml
<text-prop name="hasComment">
      <text resrefs="6618" encoding="hex64">PGEgY2xhc3M9InNhbHNhaC1saW5rIiBocmVmPSJJUkk6NjYxODpJUkkiPjxwPldlYmVybiBhbiBXaWxsaGVpbSwgMTAuMTAuMTkyODwvcD48L2E+PHA+PC9wPg==</text>
</text-prop>
```
Within one text property, simple and complex text values may be mixed.

#### `<color-prop>`-element
The color-prop eelement is used to define a color property.

_Options_:
- _"name"_: Name of the property as given in the ontology (required)

##### `<color>`-element
The color-element is used to indicate a color value. The color has to be giiven in
web-notation, that is a "#" followed by 3 or 6 hex numerals.

_Options_:
- _permissions_: ID or a permission set. Optional, but if omitted very restricted default permissions apply!
- _comment_: A comment to this specific value.

A propery with 2 color valus would be defined as follows:

    <color>#ff00ff</color>
</color-prop>
```

```

#### `<geometry-prop>`-element
Properties which contain a geometric definition for a 2-D region (e.g. on an image). Usually thes
are not created by an import and should be used with caution!

_Options_:
- _"name"_: Name of the property as given in the ontology (required)

##### `<geometry>`-element
A geometry is defined as a JSON object. It  contains the following data:
- _status_: "active" or "deleted"
- _type_: "circle", "rectangle" or "polygon"
- _lineColor_: WEB-Color
- _lineWidth_: integer number (in pixels)
- _points_: Array of coordinate objects of the form `{"x": decimal, "y": decimal}`
- _radius_: Coordinate object in the form `{"x": decimal, "y": decimal}`
Please note that all coordinates are normalized coordinates (relative to the image size)  between 0.0 and 1.0 !
The following example defines a poylgon:
```
{
   "status": "active",
   "type": "polygon",
   "lineColor": "#ff3333",
   "lineWidth": 2,
   "points: [{"x": 0.17252396166134185, "y": 0.1597222222222222},
             {"x": 0.8242811501597445,  "y": 0.14583333333333334},
             {"x": 0.8242811501597445,  "y": 0.8310185185185185},
             {"x": 0.1757188498402556,  "y": 0.8240740740740741},
             {"x": 0.1757188498402556,  "y": 0.1597222222222222},
             {"x": 0.16932907348242812, "y": 0.16435185185185186}],
   "original_index": 0
}
```
Thus, a <geometry>-element may look like:
```
<geometry>{"status":"active","type"="circle","lineColor"="#ff0000","lineWidth"=2,"points":[{"x":0.5,"y":0.5}],"radius":{"x":0.1,"y":0.0}}</geometry>
